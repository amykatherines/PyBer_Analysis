# PyBer Ride-Sharing Analysis

## Overview
PyBer's CEO has requested an analysis for ride-sharing data help the company improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. Our analysis will create visualizations of our ride-share data aggregated by city type - Rural, Suburban and Urban and viewed over time. The visualizations will assist in viewing the relationship between drivers, riders and types of city.  I'll also provide my three recommendations for the business based on the data analysis.

## Results

### City Type Summary Data

We first aggregated data by each city type - Urban, Suburban, and Rural - to view number of rides, number of drivers and total fare amouts.  We also calculated the average price of a fare and average fare by driver the city type.  You can see this data in the following chart:

In this chart, we can see that 
- Rural and Suburban drivers make more than Urban drivers by $10 and $6 respectively
- Rural and suburban drivers make more per trip but there are significantly fewer trips made in both categories when compared to urban rides.
  - Urban drivers had 13 times more trips than Rural and close to three times as many as suburban drivers. 
- Urban drivers make significantly less per driver than rural and suburban when we take the total fare divided by the total number of drivers.
- Rural has the highest average fare per ride at $35 followed by suburban at $31 and then Urban at $25.

### Total Weekly Fares by City Type

We charted out the total fare amounts each week by city type over a 4-month period at the beginning of the year 2019.  Viewing the data over time, we can evaluate if there are significant changes in the amounts earned over time as well as how each city type compares with the others.  Below is the chart rendered to show Fares over Time for each City Type:
